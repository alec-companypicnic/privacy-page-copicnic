Where applicable, we indicate whether and why you must provide us with your personal information, as well as the consequences of failing to do so. If you do not provide your personal information when requested, you may not be able to use our Services if that personal information is necessary to provide you with our Services or if we are legally required to collect it.</p>

The Services allow you to submit this audio information, text, image data, and other materials to the Services ("Prompts"), which generate responses based on your Prompts ("Outputs"). If you include personal information in your Prompts, we will collect that information, and this information may be reproduced in the Outputs.</p>

For example, when you contact us for customer support purposes, we may receive your name, email address, the contents of a message or attachments that you may send to us, and other information you choose to provide.

          <p><strong>Right to Know.</strong> You have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we have collected about you over the past 12 months, including the categories of personal information collected, the specific pieces of personal information collected, the categories of sources from which we collected the personal information, the business or commercial purpose for collecting the information, and the categories of third parties with whom we shared the personal information.</p>

For example, we may retain personal information as necessary to complete the transaction for which it was collected, provide you with ongoing support, complete internal analytics, comply with legal obligations, or make other lawful disclosures.</p>

          <p><strong>Right to Correct.</strong> You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you.</p>

          <p><strong>Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing.</strong> You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information. If we sell or share your personal information, you may exercise this right by submitting a request as described below.</p>

          <p><strong>Right to Limit Use of Sensitive Personal Information.</strong> If we use your sensitive personal information for purposes beyond providing the Services or other permitted uses under the CCPA, you have the right to direct us to limit such use.</p>

          <p><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination.</strong> You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, provide you a different level or quality of goods or services, or retaliate against you for exercising your CCPA rights.</p>

          <p><strong>How to Exercise Your Rights.</strong> To exercise any of the above rights, you may contact us by emailing us at <a href="mailto:basket@companypicnic.com">basket@companypicnic.com</a> or by writing to us at 29 Little W 12th Street, New York, NY 10014.

          <p><strong>Authorized Agent.</strong> You may authorize another person or entity to submit a request on your behalf.

          <h2>Legal Bases for Processing European Personal Information</h2>

          <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area ("EEA") or the United Kingdom ("UK"), we only process your personal information when we have a valid "legal basis," including as set forth below.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your personal information where you have consented to certain processing of your personal information.</li>
            <li><strong>Contractual Necessity.</strong> We may process your personal information where required to provide you with the Services. For example, we may need to process your personal information to respond to your inquiries or requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance with a Legal Obligation.</strong> We may process your personal information where we have a legal obligation to do so. For example, we may process your personal information to comply with tax, labor and accounting obligations.</li>
            <li><strong>Vital interests.</strong> We may process your personal information in order to protect your vital interests, or the vital interests of another natural person.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your personal information where we or a third party have a legitimate interest in processing your personal information. Specifically, we have a legitimate interest in using your personal information for product development and internal analytics purposes, and otherwise to improve the safety, security, and performance of the Services. We only rely on our or a third party's legitimate interests to process your personal information when these interests are not overridden by your rights and interests.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How We Disclose the Personal Information We Collect</h2>

            <li>You may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us regarding the processing of your personal information at any time and free of charge.

We encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing any information to them.</p>

          <h2>Retention</h2>

          <p>When you request that we do so, we take measures to delete your personal information or keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you when this personal information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we process it, unless we are required by law to keep this information for a longer period. When we process personal information for our own purposes, we determine the retention period taking into account various criteria, such as the type of services provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, possible re-enrollment with the Services, the impact on the Services we provide to you if we delete some personal information from or about you, and mandatory retention periods provided by law and the statute of limitations.</p>

          <h2>Security</h2>

          <p>We make reasonable efforts to protect your personal information by using physical and electronic safeguards designed to improve the security of the personal information we maintain. However, as no electronic transmission or storage of information can be entirely secure, we can make no guarantees as to the security or privacy of your personal information.</p>

          <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

          <p>We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from children under 13 years of age, and no part of our Services is directed to children.
